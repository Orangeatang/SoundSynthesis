Communitaion Between C# & C++
-----------------------------

* CLR representations for each type of audio object, holds an instance of said object
	- objects are created using a factor
	- pass sound system an enum to indicate which object you want to create
	- clr class is a wrapper for the generated object
	- c# displays clr class properties
	- sound system maintains all audio object instances (created by the factory)

Class Structure
---------------

AudioObject
	- derives from IObject
	- maintains a list of sources and effects

IAudioSource
	- audio source
	- has an IXAudio2SourceVoice instance
	- has an XAUDIO2_BUFFER
	- has an WAVEFORMATEX instance
	- sounds are triggered via the owning AudioObject

IAudioEffect
	- audio sound effect
